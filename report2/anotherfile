There once was an old man named Gepetto. He was a carpenter. He made things out of wood.
He was a very lonely man. One day, he made a puppet out of wood.
He took a piece of wood and started to make the puppet's face. Then he worked on the puppet's body.
When he was done, he called the puppet “Pinocchio”.
All of a sudden, the puppet's eyes started to move and his head moved too.
Then the puppet started to stand up on his feet. Gepetto was very happy.
He took Pinocchio's hands and they both started to dance. Gepetto took out some fabric and made some clothes for Pinocchio.
He made a shirt and a pair of pants. He, also made a pair of wooden shoes for Pinocchio.
Now his feet would stay warm when he walked. Pinocchio wanted to go to school like all the other real boys.
